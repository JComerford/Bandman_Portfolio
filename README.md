# Udacity Project 1: Portfolio Project

Portfolio project for Udacity.

**Purpose**
To complete project 1 before the soft deadline set for students.

**What I had to start with**
I was given a mock-up of what students should aim for when developing my portfolio.  However, we were not given starter files.  After much deliberation, I decided to hit the mock-up mostly, but add a few of my own ideas.

**Wow! Your logo is amazing! How did you make it?**
Don't make a big thing out of it. :) It was made in Paint 3D. My first attempt, ever, at a logo for myself.  Not too shabby, but improvements could be made.
